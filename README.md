## Description

It's intended for general purpose electronics and microcontroller simulation, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.
This is not an accurate simulator for circuit analisis, it aims to be the fast, simple and easy to use, so this means simple and not very accurate electronic models and limited features.
Intended for hobbist or students to learn and experiment with simple circuits.
